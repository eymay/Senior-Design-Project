\begin{frame}{Compiler Structure}
There are different stages of a compiler but they can be grouped into two main parts
such as “Front-End” and “Back-End”
	\begin {itemize}
	    \item Lexical Analysis
	    \item Syntax Analysis
	    \item Semantic Analysis
	    \item Intermediate Code Generation
	    \item Code Optimization
	    \item Target Code Generation	    
	\end {itemize}
