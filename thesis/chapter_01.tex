Recent advances and studies on Integrated Circuits (IC) caused technology to produce application-specific circuits for various areas of usage. Extensions for the open source processor architectures became a part of the industrial development. More custom accelerators are developed, especially with RISC-V open and modular instruction set architecture (ISA). Hardware accelerators have the promise of being fast and efficient.

However, loading new abilities to an extended processor comes with a problem. Programming languages and their compilers are developed for common architectures. A compiler targeting standard ISA will not produce the custom instructions for the accelerator. A compiler modification is needed to be able to introduce the accelerator to the high-level languages. In this thesis, we show various ways to approach the problem and present the best practices for it. 

%TODO Talk about LLVM

%TODO mention ascon for sbox 
For the research, several accelerators with specific custom instructions are targeted \cite{Sairoglu, eryilmaz}. Instructions which are targeted to hardware are SHLXOR, RORI and S-box. The encodings and instruction operations were mostly designed by the hardware developers. The process of required compiler modifications for SHLXOR and RORI are demonstrated in Sections \ref{sec:shlxor} and \ref{sec:rori}. S-box instruction, due to its non-linearity, was a complicated instruction to characterize. It is a good example that not every instruction can be added in a similar process and instruction-specific design can be required. 
%TODO talk about instruction design and riscv, maybe in separate paragraph after the one below
Also similar to the design of ISAs, instructions should be designed by considering both hardware and software. 

S-box instruction is analyzed from several aspects. Firstly, the Intermediate Representation (IR) optimizations it gets through are demonstrated in depth in Section \ref{sbox-case}. Secondly, the limitations of TableGen which was a sufficient system for the previous instructions, are discussed and C++ pattern matching is explained in Section \ref{sec:cpp}. 
Thirdly, pattern matching in IR and MCInst level are discussed in Section \ref{sec:patmatchdisc}. Finally, we proposed two new instructions that can be implemented in hardware that can accelerate S-box operation as LXR and NAXOR. A simplified version of LXR which has independent Load addresses is demonstrated in Section \ref{sec:lxr}. The S-box case where the load addresses are dependent is presented in C++ pattern matching in Section \ref{sec:cpp}. The second proposed instruction, NAXOR, is shown in Section \ref{sec:naxor}.

In conjunction with LXR and NAXOR which do not have target hardware, MLA instruction is also presented without target hardware. MLA is discussed in detail in Chapter \ref{Ch4} where it is traced from the C code to Assembly in steps of compilation and Section \ref{sec:MLA_add_section} where its support was added with TableGen.

\section{Purpose of Project}
Application-Specific Instruction Set Processors (ASIP) are becoming more popular with the development of embedded systems. The specialization of the core causes a tradeoff between flexibility and performance. For special purposes, using ASIPs increases efficiency, however, we can program a custom ASIP only by using assembly instructions that we defined. Programming custom processors with assembly language is not a preferred way of coding. We are also not able to use high-level languages because compiling tools are designed for common architectures with certain instructions. The ability to add custom instructions to compilers will enable us to make more use of custom hardware designs.

ASIPs are feasible for all application-specific embedded systems like consumer, industrial, automotive, home appliances, cryptology, medical, telecommunication, commercial, aerospace, and military applications. The custom back-end that we will design under the supervision of Dr. Tankut Akgül, is going to serve the processor designed by Prof. Dr. Sıddıka Berna Örs Yalçın’s research team. When the project is completed, Prof. Yalçın is going to be able to produce the assembly codes that are compatible with the processor’s extended instruction set in addition to RISC-V.


Prof. Yalçın and her team are designing application-specific instruction set processors. The purpose of this project is to create a compiler back-end for a processor that supports custom instructions on top of RISC-V instructions. This compiler is going to help to program the custom processor by using high-level languages. Existing RISC-V compilers are not able to produce efficient assembly codes for ASIPs. Therefore a need arose for a compiler back-end.
The main reason for choosing this project is that we wanted to meet an actual need for a critical existing problem. The project has the potential to be the bridge between hardware and software of custom hardware projects in research, enabling them to be candidates for production use cases.
