\begin{frame}{Problems with SelectionDAG}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Developed since 2005s
        \item Monolithic, hard to test passes
        \item Works on basic blocks, cannot access DAG of two functions at the same time.
        \item Affects compile time significantly
        \item Documentation is scarce
        \item Hard to debug as the DAG is built in memory
    \end{itemize}
    The new alternative is GlobalISel which addresses these problems but is still under development for RISC-V target.

    GlobalISel is default for AArch64 target.
