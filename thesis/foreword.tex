At the outset we would like to express our sincere thanks and gratitude to our project advisor Dr. Tankut Akgül who kindly provided us  academic support and guidance throughout our efforts. Without his support and encouragement we would not be able to overcome the difficulties encountered over the course of our studies.  We would like to express our gratitude to him for helping us make progress with the project. We would also like to take this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude and appreciation to Prof. Sıddıka Berna Örs Yalçın for shaping our targets and supporting us. LLVM community was greatly helpful and thus, we are thankful to them as well. Finally, we would like to thank our families and friends who did not spare their moral support during our university education.
