CONCLUSION BURAYA GELEBILIR!!!!

\section{Practical Application of This Project}
This project can be useful for increasing the efficiency of applications that require the frequent use of specific instructions. Cryptography applications with RISC-V may be one of these.

\section{Realistic Constraints}
LLVM is a huge infrastructure and while working with it, sometimes it may be hard to find what you are looking for. Also, there aren’t many sources or documentation to find solutions to the specific problems that we encounter which sometimes slows down the progress.

\subsection{Social, Environmental, and Economic Impact}
The end product is going to help the custom processor to be programmed by a high level programming language. It will make the programming of the custom processor a more efficient process and encourage the use of the custom processor. Because of this efficiency, the energy and time costs would be reduced during the programming of the processor. Also, using a custom processor for handling a problem is faster and requires less power. Therefore, encouraging the use of one would be another benefit of the end product.

\subsection{Cost Analysis}
Open-source tools and programs were used on our computers during the project. Therefore, it wasn’t costly for us.

\subsection{Standards}
LLVM project is very selective on the technologies they use. Latest versions of C++ and build tools with software engineering principles are followed. Instructions abide by the RISC-V instruction set standard.

\subsection{Health and Safety Concerns}
Since we are working on software area, there is no possible risk of harm to users.
