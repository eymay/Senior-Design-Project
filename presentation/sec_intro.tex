\begin{itemize}
        \item Programming languages and their compilers are developed for common architectures.
        \item A compiler targeting standard ISA will not produce the custom instructions for a custom hardware.
	\item A compiler modification is needed to be able to introduce a custom hardware
to the high-level languages.
	\item In this project, we aimed to solve this problem by supporting custom instructions with LLVM.
    \end{itemize}
